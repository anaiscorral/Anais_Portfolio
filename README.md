[Project 1: Home Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/anaiscorral/Home-Credit-Default-Risk)
- Built a supervised classification model to predict loan default risk for clients with limited credit history.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data, handled missing values, and aligned training and test sets.
- Implemented and compared models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using metrics like AUC, precision, and recall.
- Identified key predictors (e.g., demographic and external scores) to improve credit risk assessment.
- Delivered business recommendations to enhance financial inclusion and reduce loan defaults.

**Key predictors we used for modeling (highest correlation).**

[Project 2: iFood | Penalized Regression](https://github.com/anaiscorral/Penalized-Regression-Machine-Learning)

- Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing for modeling readiness.
- Selected key predictors to enhance model performance and reduce noise.
- Applied Ridge and Lasso regression to address multicollinearity and optimize predictions.
- Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation for improved model performance.
- Evaluated models with metrics like MSE and R-squared to ensure accuracy.
- Visualized coefficient shrinkage and predictor importance to highlight the impact of regularization.

**Correlation Matrix. This will help determine which variables are the most or least important.**
